/// Request to initialize the language server.
///
/// This is the first request sent by the client, providing the server with the client's
/// capabilities, configuration options, and initial information about the current workspace. The
/// server replies with its own capabilities, which allows the two sides to agree about the set of
/// supported protocol methods and values.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - processId: The process identifier (pid) of the client process.
///   - rootURI: The workspace URI, or nil if no workspace is open.
///   - initializationOptions: User-provided options.
///   - capabilities: The capabilities provided by the client editor.
///   - trace: Whether to enable tracing.
///   - workspaceFolders: The workspace folders configured, if the client supports multiple workspace
///     folders.
///
/// - Returns:
