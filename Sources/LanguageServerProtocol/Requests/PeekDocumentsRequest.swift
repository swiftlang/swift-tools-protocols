/// Request from the server to the client to show the given documents in a "peeked" editor **(LSP Extension)**
///
/// This request is handled by the client to show the given documents in a
/// "peeked" editor (i.e. inline with / inside the editor canvas). This is
/// similar to VS Code's built-in "editor.action.peekLocations" command.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - uri: The DocumentURI of the text document in which to show the "peeked" editor
///   - position: The position in the given text document in which to show the "peeked editor"
///   - locations: The DocumentURIs of documents to appear inside the "peeked" editor
///
/// - Returns: `PeekDocumentsResponse` which indicates the `success` of the request.
///
/// ### LSP Extension
///
/// This request is an extension to LSP supported by SourceKit-LSP.
/// It requires the experimental client capability `"workspace/peekDocuments"` to use.
/// It also needs the client to handle the request and present the "peeked" editor.
